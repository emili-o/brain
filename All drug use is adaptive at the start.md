> “Whether used for recreation, escape, or mental enhancement, the initial use of drugs is most often adaptive, that is, beneficial in some way. A person uses the drug, perhaps only out of curiosity, to gain an effect that is experienced as positive. Those who continue to “chase the first high,” and who develop problems associated with continued drug or alcohol use, are typically people who lack a fuller repertoire of adaptive skills than their peers.”
